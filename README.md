# Robot-hand-gesture-imitating
Boston University ME 740 term project code of gesture recoginize with Baidu AIP and AipBodyAnalysis SDK fold

Robotic hands have always been the spotlight of popular technology. In particular, the biomimetic anthropomorphic robot hand that uses EMG sensors that analyze muscle electrical activity to control the arm has always been the focus of IEEE Spectrum. For my project, I want to combine what we will learn in the class about vision and robotics and pose-based (PBVS) visual servoing to let the robot hand copy simple gestures and motions of a human hand, such as bending a single finger or making a fist.
